# australia-road-crash-data-analysis
A data warehousing project based on Australian road crash data, featuring dimensional modeling, ETL with Python, SQL-based analytics, data visualization and association rule mining.

#### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

* Design a dimensional model (fact and dimension tables) following Kimballâ€™s methodology.
* Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using Python.
* Populate a star or snowflake schema using cleaned and transformed data.
* Execute analytical SQL queries to answer business questions.
* Generate visual insights using Power BI or similar tools.
* Explore association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm.

#### Contents

* data/: Raw and cleaned datasets used for ETL.
* etl/: Python scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and loading.
* sql/: SQL scripts to create and populate the data warehouse schema.
* queries/: Business queries and their outputs.
* visualizations/: Dashboards and graphs for data insights.
* association_rules/: Code and results for pattern mining using Apriori.
* report/: Final PDF report including design, methodology, and results.

#### Tools and Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, mlxtend)
* PostgreSQL / MySQL (for DW schema)
* Power BI / Tableau (for data visualization)
* DB Browser / pgAdmin (for schema management)
